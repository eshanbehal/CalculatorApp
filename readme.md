                      Hey guys just started my first project in android ie CALCULATOR APP.
                   =========================================================================



1. Just started off my first project in android #Calculator app by placing off some widgets onto my 
   activity page.

2. trying to make a basic calculator that can be used for calculations.Also focusing on to make a caqlculator 
   layout for the landscape mode as well using constraints.

3. Just came to know about really intresting feature in the andrpid studio which can be a life saver for all us
   programmers ie COMPARING FILES WITH OTHER FILES.

   under this we can keep a safe copy of our code in our comp nd after changing some of our code , we want to check where
   the error is or we are editiong the code of some other app form git for spome changes.if qwe have the original source 
   code available then we can com[pare both the codes.

   but firstly we should REARRANGE AND REFORMAT THE CODE . Thewn we can go in View option nd select COMPARE nd select our file
   with which we want to compare our code and we can also SYNCHRONIZE our code both ways.
   
   its a really amazing feature builtin android studio.HOPE it helps..

4. As we can compare the files with other similarly we can also compare DIRECTORIES with other directories but this can be little
   confusing and frustrarting as in this to compare directories we have to check whether the COMPANYDOMAIN for both the directories 
   is same or not.if its not the same it can be slightly difficult for us to ocmpare directories.

5. Also have added some java code after designing my layout page for my calculator app in order to make my buttons working.
