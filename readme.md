                      Hey guys just started my first project in android ie CALCULATOR APP.
                   =========================================================================



1. Just started off my first project in android #Calculator app by placing off some widgets onto my 
   activity page.

2. trying to make a basic calculator that can be used for calculations.Also focusing on to make a caqlculator 
   layout for the landscape mode as well using constraints.

3. Just came to know about really intresting feature in the andrpid studio which can be a life saver for all us
   programmers ie COMPARING FILES WITH OTHER FILES.

   under this we can keep a safe copy of our code in our comp nd after changing some of our code , we want to check where
   the error is or we are editiong the code of some other app form git for spome changes.if qwe have the original source 
   code available then we can com[pare both the codes.

   but firstly we should REARRANGE AND REFORMAT THE CODE . Thewn we can go in View option nd select COMPARE nd select our file
   with which we want to compare our code and we can also SYNCHRONIZE our code both ways.
   
   its a really amazing feature builtin android studio.HOPE it helps..

   
    symbol shown at the end of the code line ">>".

4. As we can compare the files with other similarly we can also compare DIRECTORIES with other directories but this can be little
   confusing and frustrarting as in this to compare directories we have to check whether the COMPANYDOMAIN for both the directories 
   is same or not.if its not the same it can be slightly difficult for us to ocmpare directories.

5. Also have added some java code after designing my layout page for my calculator app in order to make my buttons working.

6. after all the implementation of the widgets finally added code in java to implment the operation in java in order to make the app
   working.

   used the switch statement in order to implemnt the operations on the operands.

   =================


1. just started today by adding some more code for my buttons to function properly.started by creating onclicklistners for the operations
   buttons.

2. jst made my basic calculator working by implementing the operations in the java file.try once. will be updating code when needed.

3. jst added the functionality to my app by writing code for the implementation of operations on the operands.

   wanted to add that used "value" instead of operand 2 inorder to reduce the complexity of the code.

4. jst forgot to add also modified my code for the bug fixes regarding the decimal pt and also used try and catch statement for
   fixing the bug.nd also created a different res file for the landscape layout in order to make the calculator work smoothly
   when views changed with the mobile.

   nd at last inorder to save the instances from the portrait view to landscape view , a kind of bug only used the onsaveinstancestate
   nd onrestoreinstance state nd wrote  the code under the same by overriding both these codes in the java file.

   
       11th june
    ===============

1. jst started today by learning some imp concepts about constraining the widgets for each view ie portrait as well as landscape.

2. read about the use of GUIDELINES in order to constraint our views for the different views.used this thing in order to center 
   my widgets.
   these can be added either from top symbol placed with magnewt button or jst by right clicking in the design and from there selecting
   helpers option nd selecting guidelines for horizontal or vertical.

  *Vertical guidelines have a width of zero and the height of their constraint layout parent.where as 
  
  *Horizontal guidelines have a height zero and width of their constraint layout parent.



  
   for more info can go to this link : https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/Guideline.html



3. at last i have set the layout for both portrait and landscape with help of guide lines and setting other constraints values.

4. Also added a new functionality to my calculator by adding a negation button to it and implemented it in my app.

   it provide us the ability to enter the negative numbers for the calculation.


   just wait nd watch for more future improvements.Right now jst thinking to add more and more functionality to my 
   app...:)



   will be updating soon with some new features....


   









   Will be adding info to this file for better understanding of my project.
